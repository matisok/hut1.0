    Good ice all the way. Highlight of the weekend. I found the second pitch pretty steep and sustained. Top belay was in-situ slings with maillon around a block (as opposed to the guidebook bolted belay) and the half-way belay and abseil point was to in-situ bala-threads without maillon. The guidebook description is odd: we walked up easy slope to the what we would describe as the first pitch. Did then a full rope length (50m) on quite steep ice and then a second 40m to the top with some bridging out of the left rock wall.

    Nice  long and easy for the grade I thought. Abseil on trees all the way down on the right facing the waterfall. Worked fine on a 50m rope.

    Excellent route at the main face of Haller. First pitch requires solid worming skills - bring a Camelot 4 for the crux. Second pitch is more difficult than the guidebook suggests but it does go. Be a bit careful going across the boulder choke and make sure you find the good hand hold on the right going through the final roof. Exposed. Well worth it. Walk off the crag going all the way across the ledges to the path in the forest. Yoor!

Having pushed the limit quite a bit already I wasn't quite sure that I wanted to lead the magnificiently positioned slab which looked completely unprotected from below.

I was then left on my own on the ledge 25 meter above the ground  waiting for Tim to throw down a rope from the top. This he did  and I finished the route. Nice little Tuesday evening epic.

      September 1991. My first ever climb. Jesper Ritzau took Simon Hauch and me up this 2 pitch route on Aakermansberget on Kullen. I was pretty excited for almost a whole year having done this one climb. It was good fun and it was the start of something big!

    Axels first SRT trip
01-08-2021; MD; Swildons Hole; ; 1h; FW AX EW; <3><C1><1S><P https://flic.kr/p/2mgdA44>
    We got to the down climbs.
01-08-2021; MD; Goatchurh Cavern; ; 2h; FW AX EW; <3><C2><3S>
    Axel and Elias did the drainpipe.
13-11-2005; LL; Agen Allwedd; ; 11h; TW MB; <3><C4><3S> 
     Excellent digging trip to dig 9. Also saw the Corkscrew Chamber which was found the day before.
19-03-2005; LL; Agen Allwedd; ; 14h; MB RS; <3><C4><3S>
     13 hours spankotronic. With John Stevens
20-11-2004; LL;  Agen Allwedd; ; 8h; MB; <3><C4><3S>
     A visit to the digface in Grolsch Passage. Managed to make about 2 meters progress  removing 22 trays of spoil. The whole passage is really impressive. 
19-05-2004; LL; Agen Allwedd; ; 11h; RS MB; <3><C4><3S>
     Continuing the dig. Excellent burly trip. I enjoyed being at the sharp end much more this TWe. We've hit a boulder section.
16-05-2004; LL; Agen Allwedd; ; 12h; MB; <3><C4><3S>
     Digging trip towards Daren. Excellent team effort  hard work  but good fun. Digging is not for the claustrophic amongst us. 
27-03-2004; PD; Maskhill Mine; ; 7h; TW RS MB; <3><C4><3><C4><3S>
     Brilliant rig. World class. The subsequent connection was an ultra burly bit of caving. I was particularly traumatised by the gravel/stream squeeze that nearly caught me on the return. Next TWe I'll remember to turn my head the right way. Good effort from MB leading this bit  and not drowning while reversing in the sump. Double black helmet.
30-01-2004; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 22h; RS MB AW FW; <3><C4><3S>
     Highlights: sucessfull use of heyphone  wading through bonzai streamway  pushing to Aquenos Choke. Exit series felt hard. 
07-11-2003; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 45h; RS MB; <3><C4><3S>
     Two-nighter into Dweebland (the end of the cave so far). Excellent trip. Flawlessly executed. We let off two smoke bombs (one failed) at the end to see if there's a draught towards Aggen Allwed. There is. Get your crowbars out!
07-12-2002; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 32h; TW MB RS PW; <3><C4><3S>
     Trip to the restaurant of the end of the universe
27-07-2002; VC; Scialet de la Chique; ; 3h; FW; <3><C3>
     Fred's first rig in the VC unmedium. The pendulum was as festive as ever  and worth noting is that we managed to get up that climb in the end (fairly committing) taking us all the way to the bottom.
07-06-2002; VC; Scialet de la Chique; ; 3h; MB; <3><C2>
     Excellent cave - easy in all respects (rig and walkin). Martin regained his unfire with a steady lead to the bottom. All bolts overtightened subtracts a star  good photoshooting and muddy fun adds it back.
06-06-2002; VC; Scialet du Pot de Loup; ; 3h; PW; <3><C2>
     Nice trip with Paul which regained his interest in caving. A great easy cave.
05-06-2002; VC; Scialet du Pot 2; ; 1h; MB TW; <3><C4><3S><Q>
     The Pot 2 attempt - Grosvenor style. Martin lead down to -80 meters. To be continued.
04-06-2002; VC; Scialet de Malaterre; ; 1h; MB PW TW; <3>
     Tried out my new caving radios which works extremely well on these long vertical pitches.
03-06-2002; VC; Scialet A2; ; 5h; MB; <3><C4><3S>
     Full on caving. Included a dangerous 25 meter pitch lead in Wellingtons with only a sling and my bolt kit (thank god for that) as protection. Fantastic cave - highly recommendable.
18-05-2002; VC; Scialet de Malaterre; ; 4h; ; <3><C3>
     Great initiation trip for the new speleo recruit. Messed up the logistics by forgetting one descender at the training wall back in the hut. We managed nevertheless and bottomed out the main shaft in style. Good effort from James it being his first real vertical cave.
16-03-2002; VC; Glaciere d'Autrans; ; 4h; MB; <3><C4><3S>
     Desperate. Approach was as hard as ever and the amount of ice in the cave was worrying, although on the same time ultra festive. Martin fired up an inspirational ice-stal-chopping session as we were stopped but an almost complete blockage of ice in the entrace tunnel. Reaching a depth of approximately 100 meters we eventually decided that this was a black helmet danger zone. Huge television sized blocks of broken off ice was scattered around the shaft, and after a quick statistic calculation on when the next bit of ice could be coming down, we decided to blow retreat horn and hurried out after exhaustive cold caving session.
15-03-2002; VC; Scialet des Joufflus; ; 4h; MB; <3><C3>
     Excellent job to the bottom. The route finding to the last pitch is a bit tricky until you realize you have to gnarl your way through a hole in the roof (upwards) with the festive aid of a spit/stal sling. The squeeze to the beginning of the last pitch is not as bad as it looks - go in feet first  and you can stand up half way (not imidiately obvious). Yoor!
02-03-2002; VC; Scialet des Joufflus; ; 3h; AW; <3><C3>
     Really easy when you've already done it once (but not all the way to the deck). The approach was definitely the crux walking in thigh/waist deep snow to the cave. A festive day. Good effort from Andrew who hadn't caved for 10 years and was srt'ing on a rather made up and minimal rack.
23-02-2002; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 28h; MB RS TW JT; <3><C4><3S><3S>
     Long trip with an overnight camp in the Hard Rock Cafe. The further speed trip to The Microns was a seriously burly piece of work. Good effort from Martin doing the car shuttle on foot both ways and for the amble lager refreshments in the Hard Rock Cafe and Royston for the very inspirering bit of cave leading in the Rock Steady Cruise.
03-02-2002; VC; Grotte de Bournilllon; ; 2h; ; <3><C3>
     Went up to have a look. Couldn't resist. Went in. Normal way too wet  so I opted for the highlevel dry fossil way which was much longer than I expected and with some pretty nasty (but polished and obvious) squezes. Good training  but cave soloing doesn't feel very clever.
09-12-2001; VC; Trou du Diable; ; 1h; ; <3><C3>
     Solo
02-12-2001; YS; Gaping Gill; ; 3h; TW MB RS; <3><C4><3S><M>
     Lateral Shaft. Superb rig avoiding most of the water of the main shaft. Mindblowing
02-12-2001; YS; Gaping Gill; ; 3h; TW MB RS JT; <3><C4><3S>
     Main Shaft. Wild decent. Although the water level was low we ended up right in the end waterfall which is serious stuff and very scary but excellent adrenalin fun at the same TWe. The tick is home!
01-12-2001; YS; Rowten Pot; ; 3h; TW RS MB; <3><C3>
     Excellent sporty rig.
27-11-2001; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 7h; MB RS; <3><C3>
     Fantastic trip. Made it to the Bonsai Streamway and back.
25-11-2001; LL; Ogof Ffynnon Ddu; ; 6h; MB RS; <3><C2>
     A job needed to be finished. We wanted to finish yesterdays objective of getting to Smiths Armery but the area was in flood now and we made it past the traverses into OFD3 and reached the roaring streamway which was fantastic to watch but a certain deathtrap to enter. Great trip
24-11-2001; LL; Ogof Ffynnon Ddu; ; 6h; DG RS MB; <3><C2>
     We did an unplanned round trip due to some tricky navigation in the Shambles. On one of the many tricky climbs Tom lobbed of and fell around three meters  but luckily landed on his feet and not on one of the sharp boulders. He sprained his angle badly and we abandoned the trip and got out safely.
14-10-2001; VC; Grotte Gournier; ; 1h; JR; <3><C1>
     Jesper's first caving experience. Another team was already in there  which unfortunately took the edge of the scaryness factor and it was  really plain sailing. Still enjoyable.
30-09-2001; VC; Grotte Gournier; ; 4h; WW; <3><C2>
     As festive as caving gets. This huge and relatively easy cave is  guarded by a big lake  which we crossed in my new rubber dinghy. Seriously  festive approach. Followed by a 6 meter steep climb directly from the  mooring spot and then a 30 meter high leve traverse with some fairly serious exposure. Great cave.
23-09-2001; VC; Scialet de Pot de Loup; ; 4h; DS; <3><C2>
     Good SRT initiation trip for David. We went down the 40 meter pitch and then up again. Got through most of the SRT curriculum including a helping hand from above once or twice. It was raining heavily the whole day  but the cave stayed dry.
10-06-2001; CR; Trou de Glaz; ; 1h; DS; <3><C1>
     Went back for a further exploration. Annabel announced her disgust of the un-rock but David is keen on more. This cave is massive. Over 50  kilometers of known passageway with numerous through trips under Dent de  Crolles. The mountain is basically completely hollow and will be the focus  of activity in the near future. As with all Grenoblois speleoaction it  requires a fully equipped SRT team to explore.
24-05-2001; CR; Trou de Glaz; ; 20m; MB CW; <3><C1>
     Walked up the Dent de Crolles. Nipped in to a huge cavity with our c-rack.  Massive draft coming out of the cave. Will be back for further  exploration.
23-05-2001; VC; Scialet de Pot de Loup; ; 3h; MB; <3><C2>
     Absolutely superb SRT trip. Beautiful lines and an amazing 40m drop from an overhanging speleothem. Easy and highly recommendable. Approach - 8 seconds from the car.
20-05-2001; VC; Glaciere d'Autrans; ; 9h; MB; <3><C4><3S>
     Long day out. 13 hours including the walk. We got back to Grenoble at 4am  in the morning. See map
19-05-2001; VC; Trou de Diable; ; 1h; MB; <3><C3>
     Beautiful walk-in - quite long. Descended amazing looking shaft (140  meters straight!). 10 meter down bolt ripped. Mission aborted. Glad to be  alive. See map
15-04-2001; VC; Scialet des Joufflus; ; 3h; MB; <3><C2>
     Beautiful cave - lots of little lakes and excellent formations. Perfect  rig as well. See map
11-04-2001; VC; Glaciere de Carri; ; 7h; MB; <3><C4><3S><3><C4>
     Desperate trip. Got back up to the surface at 12'o'clock at night after a  long day in the darkness. Our friends in Grenoble was getting well worried  and had started phoning the local police etc. Luckily they sensibly held  back any rescue attempts as we were perfectly fine. Glaciere de Scary!
10-04-2001; VC; Scialet de Fee Anglaise; ; 4h; MB; <3><C2>
     Excellent cave  ends in a big lake which goes of in the distance. Next  time we'll bring a boat and explore further. This TWe we both put the  double amount of clothes on and was relatively warm. See map
09-04-2001; VC; Scialet de Malaterre; ; 6h; MB; <3><C4><3S>
     Massive cave shaft - starts with a 120 meter (360ft) drop of a bridge -  straight down in to the void. Desperate trip - quite wet and extremely  cold. See map 
05-12-2000; MD; Manor Farm Swallet; ; 4h; DG MB; <3><C3>
     I decided to postpone the UK underground retirement for one more trip - I  couldn't say no to a trip down Manor Farm with DG and MB. I wasn't  disappointed. DG now goes under the nickname 'Mr. President' (president  for the HPCC) and I had the great pleasure of pushing through some really  dodgy loose bouldery bits in the far end which was rewarded with a huge  chamber which almost certainly had some further continuation. DG and  MB unfortunately didn't reach this glorious chamber as they reckoned  the boulder bits were too unstable.
18-11-2000; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 6h; FW; <3><C4><3S>
     Did it! RR went with us for 10 meters and then decided to back out after  a worm attacked her in the entrance. We'd seriously misproportioned the  whole cave - the entrance crawl and chambers beyond was much bigger than  expected. We forgot the map which ment we couldn't make it further than the Great Chamber
16-11-2000; MD; Thrupe Lane Swallet; ; 4h; FW DG TW; <3><C2>
     Did the full through trip. A great evening out with TW and DG -  possible the last for a long TWe now that FW's going back to Denmark  and Mathias is going bigger voids in Grenoble.
14-10-2000; MD; Goatchurch Cavern; ; 2h; RR LH; <3><C3>
     Brilliant trip. Laerke's first ever caving trip and she was so on for it  that we decided to do the full Goaty - into the letterbox and back. It's  f*cking scary in there - sort of smells of evil and it was a stupendious effort from the girls.
12-10-2000; MD; Fairy/Hillier's Cave; ; 4h; FW TR RR; <3><C2>
     The Rhoades sisters had an unsettled bill in the sump of this fine system.  We went all the way  through Cambridge Grotto to the Red Room. Good to be  back.
08-10-2000; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 2h; FW RR; <3><C3>
     Oh baby! This hole had been on the ticklist for quite some TWe and still  is! We had to turn back approx 350 meters in through the 530m crawl that  guards the cave. RR had some bad equipment and was freezing and we decided to go back before it would be too late. I have the feeling we will be back - soon.
25-09-2000; MD; GB Cavern; ; 3h; FW RR DG TR; <3><C2>
     Fine trip. DG pointed out a number of challenges which we should attempt  soon.
24-09-2000; MD; Sidcot's Swallet; ; 2h; FW RR; <3><C2>
     We got as far as the 'very narrow tube' and despite Mathias' attempt of  squeezing through in underpants only  there was no way it would go. Good  trip.
26-05-2000; MD; Goatchurch Cavern; ; 2h; FW; <3><C2>
     Our sister Henriette went to Bristol to figure out why her brothers like  caving. She didn't find the answer  but found out she is definitely not  desperate to get underground again
23-04-2000; YS; Bull Pot; ; 4h; FW; <3><C3>
     A hidden gem. Excellent rig. The line is just pure beauty.
22-04-2000; YS; Hurnel Moss Pot; ; 6h; FW; <3><C3>
     Long walk. Long rig. Well worth it. FW rigged the hole thing.
21-04-2000; YS; Alum Pot; ; 2h; FW; <3><C2>
     Such an amazing hole in the ground. It was raining and there was quite a  bit of water.
15-04-2000; MD; Eastwater Cavern; ; 4h; FW; <3><C2>
     Great little Saturday afternoon adventure. It was/had been raining a  reasonable amount and there was a sizable stream entering the cave. We  managed to do a nice round trip
15-03-2000; MD; Thrupe Lane Swallet; ; 4h; FW TW; <3><C2>
     Excellent trip. Did a 'double' abseil simultaneously next to each other  and swapped over in the bottom 
07-03-2000; MD; Shatter Cave; ; 2h; FW TW DG; <3><C2>
     Very pretty cave in the Fairy Quarry. It's normally locked  so you need an  official guide for this stuff. Impressive formations 
25-02-2000; MD; Thrupe Lane Swallet; ; 4h; TW; <3><C2>
     We did the Latheral Aven pitch. But we missed our honoured caving mentor  DG Grosvenor who unfortunately had other obligations this Friday  evening 
07-12-1999; MD; Thrupe Lane Swallet; ; 4h; TW DG; <3><C2>
     The second big SRT trip after Rhino Rift to do in the MD. We did it  in three pitches - excellent stuff. We will be back soon to do the big  200ft single pitch 
28-11-1999; MD; Fairy/Hillier's Cave; ; 3h; TW; <3><C3>
     A job needed to be done and TW and I went in to finish the Fairy Cave  business. We reached the 'Red Room' which is in the connected Hilliers  Cave and is the furtherst reach of the system. Quite an amazing system and  very well worth it. Recommendable 
21-11-1999; MD; Fairy Quarry Cave; ; 1h; MI; <3><C2>
     Not an ideal trip. I forgot to stock up on carbide  and didn't have a lot of juice in the batteries. So we went in as far as the duck  and probably partly because I was nervous about the lights  Mikkel didn't fancy the duck  and we blew retreat and went out. Shame  because I would have liked to show Mikkel the Red Room.
20-11-1999; MD; Lionels Hole; ; 3h; FW; <3><C4><3S>
     Awesome trip. We did the round trip which has some extremely challenging  routefinding speically on the return. We were very pleased to get out 
09-11-1999; MD; GB Cavern; ; 4h; DG TW; <3>
     Great evening out in the MD. GB has some really awesome formations  and some quite entertaining squeezes 
17-10-1999; MD; Swildon's Hole; ; 4h; FW; <3>
     We were back to complete the round trip that we had attempted with Peter  three entries down. This TWe the mud sump that we had rushed through was  filled to the roof with water and after an hour or more of pumping water  with no noticeable effect we went to explore the Black Hole Series  instead. This ended when we arrived at a 40 foot pitch. Good day out. We  were both exhausted 
19-09-1999; MD; Rhino Rift; ; 2h; TW; <3>
     We got a hold of the key yet again. TW rigged and I de-rigged 
14-09-1999; MD; Fairy Quarry Cave; ; 3h; FW DG; <3>
     We went in with DG Grosvenor on a good trip in to the wonders of Fairy  Cave. A surprisingly muddy experience. Some good technical obstacles to  keep the wriggling techniques uptodate. A Grosvenor Special.  Slide show 
08-08-1999; MD; Swildon's Hole; ; 4h; FW PS; <3>
     An excellent trip! We went into the St. PW Grotto Series which included  some very low crawls and passing a mud sump. Peter did well in this -not-  a beginners section of the cave. We didn't manage the through trip though  since Peter started having more than enough. We didn't realize that this actually was our probably one and only chance of ticking this sought after Swildon's collectors piece. Bummer!
31-05-1999; MD; Swildon's Hole; ; 4h; FW TW RR; <3>
     Good Trip. TR and RR both did Sump 1 in freezing cold water and in  a very uninviting condition. RR even managed to become a 'Son of The  MD*' as she fell into one of the pools twice. *) Read the guidebook  for a further explanation 
09-04-1999; MD; Swildon's Hole; ; 10m; LK HL; <3>
     I took Lars and Helene down Swildons Hole for a grand caving trip.  Unfortunately the mission was aborted shortly after entering the cave due  to too much 'noia' 
09-04-1999; MD; Goatchurch Cavern; ; 1h; LK HL; <3>
     After the failed attempt in Swildons we went for the Goatchurch instead -  objective: to go through the drainpipe. We got to it after some persuasion  but that was as far as the party wanted to go. Drainpipe 2 - Lars Klammer  0 
25-03-1999; MD; St. Cuthberts Swallet; ; 3h; FW DG TW; <3>
     The yearly 'Insult DG' trip was as festive as ever. Sparrow treated us  with several muddy squeezes and a good selection of pretty formations 
14-03-1999; YS; Simpson's Pot; ; 3h; FW TW RS; <3>
     Tried a 'canyoning rappel' technique for the abseils. Worked okay  but  figures of eights and doubling the rope is preferable
07-03-1999; MD; Manor Farm Swallet; ; 4h; DG; <3>
     A bit of a project. Check out the Trip Note with a little drawing 
07-03-1999; MD; Goatchurch Cavern; ; 2h; FW; <3>
     We finally managed to get all the way in to the 'letterbox' - the furthest  end of the classic cave. The letterbox is an extremely tight squeeze  section very awkward  specially on the return 
29-12-1998; MX; Cueva Miso Ha; ; 1h; FW TR; <3>
     Mathias negotiated a tricky entrance to a cave with a waterfall coming out  of it. Ended in some muddy dig business
27-12-1998; MX; Cueva Xtacumbilxun?n; ; 2h; FW TR; <3>
     Some interesting exploration but we didn't go down the main shaft where it  looked really interesting. No SRT kit. Very visited

     Big chambers  bats  spiders  lake with potential  river  lots of potential  side passages  one easy squeeze. Total virgin experience. Only very few  traces of humans. Unique. FW managed to catch the 'Bat Disease' or  Histoplasmosis as it is apparently called - pretty nasty  lasted for  weeks  but he survived. Only he nows sleeps hanging from the ceiling 
08-12-1998; GM; Lanquin; ; 1h; FW; <3>

15-11-1998; YS; Gaping Ghyll; ; 4h; TW; <3>
      Bar Pot. Possible my best caving trip so far. Interesting SRT'ing  good deal of  route finding and a long section of tunnels. All rewarded with the  inconceivable main chamber of Gaping Ghyll. Photos

     What a cave! Massive 60 meter free abseil down the amazing shaft

     The entrance of Otter Hole has an exiting feature. The river Wye is tidal  so the entrance is only open an hour or two during low tide. When the  water comes in the entrance (and exit!) closes for about 10 hours which  means that once we enter we are comitted for the whole day. Read the whole  Trip report
