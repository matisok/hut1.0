    Exploring a new area near Dingle. True adventure climbing place. This route is a short little piece with grand routes behind.

    Pure splitter on sharp rock. Crack between hands and fists, but plenty of depth to take the whole arm. Super pleased to get to the top clean despite being spanked at the final bit. Just brilliant. No gloves.

    So close to ticking this beauty clean. It was basically the final move and I was spanked and didn't have enough umph to pull over the lip. Got it after a quick hang on the friend. Perfect hand size all the way. Gloves.

    Absolutely brilliant route. Great lead from Kristian who unfortunately subsequently had to withdraw from climbing and resort to belaying only. Problems with elbows.

    Very close to a real mother of a whipper. I went up above my last nut placement to commit to the crux move and accidently kicked the nut out with my foot. That ment I was now in a committing move and looking at a double length whipper with hurting consequences. I managed to reverse the moves and while loosing power to the pump I just managed to place a friend in, clip it and Tim took in for me to rest and re callibrate.

    Good ice all the way. Highlight of the weekend. I found the second pitch pretty steep and sustained. Top belay was in-situ slings with maillon around a block (as opposed to the guidebook bolted belay) and the half-way belay and abseil point was to in-situ bala-threads without maillon. The guidebook description is odd: we walked up easy slope to the what we would describe as the first pitch. Did then a full rope length (50m) on quite steep ice and then a second 40m to the top with some bridging out of the left rock wall.

    Excellent route at the main face of Haller. First pitch requires solid worming skills - bring a Camelot 4 for the crux. Second pitch is more difficult than the guidebook suggests but it does go. Be a bit careful going across the boulder choke and make sure you find the good hand hold on the right going through the final roof. Exposed. Well worth it. Walk off the crag going all the way across the ledges to the path in the forest. Yoor!

    Climbed with Pete from the internet. Meeting him was a fun story. Hooked up prior to Facebook and all that - internet was more a forum for nerds (like me). We met at a bar in BourgdOissan and Pete was a travelling ice climber just like I was at my trips to Chamonix before I moved to Grenoble. So he was carrying _all_ his gear and was fairly random in general. After we had climbed he kept sticking to me and came to my flat at Valentines day walking up the stairs in ski boots. As I was courtisating Celine at the time (we had just met) I was a bit in a dilemma inviting him in. The dilemma was a lot of fun.

    Due to our almost unprotected adventure we decided to try some bolt clipping. I had to pull on the quickdraw in the crux. Great route if you can climb that grade! Oh yeah  we tried Western Front Direct first. That's E56b on bolts. Paul lowered me off from the impossible roof.

    Superb Saturday out in Wintours. Excellent routes which for me climaxed in this 135 foot hidden gem. Shame about the bolts left of the route which obscures the face a lot. Great hidden line though.

             We climbed this Wintour's Leap classic in perfect conditions. Tim had a rare lack of confidence and I lowered him down from the midway stance. I was then left on my own on the ledge 25 meter above the ground  waiting for Tim to throw down a rope from the top. This he did  and I finished the route. Nice little Tuesday evening epic.

    My first proper iceclimb. Good stuff  although a bit thin and delicate at places. Released a huge rock which thundered down the gully which was packed with 4-5 other teams. Not good! Nobody got hurt luckily.

     Brilliant rig. World class. The subsequent connection was an ultra burly bit of caving. I was particularly traumatised by the gravel-stream squeeze that nearly caught me on the return. Next time I will remember to turn my head the right way. Good effort from Martin leading this bit and not drowning while reversing in the sump. Double black helmet.

     Two-nighter into Dweebland (the end of the cave so far). Excellent trip. Flawlessly executed. We let off two smoke bombs (one failed) at the end to see if there's a draught towards Aggen Allwed. There is. Get your crowbars out!

     Great initiation trip for the new speleo recruit. Messed up the logistics by forgetting one descender at the training wall back in the hut. We managed nevertheless and bottomed out the main shaft in style. Good effort from James it being his first real vertical cave.

     Desperate. Approach was as hard as ever and the amount of ice in the cave was worrying, although on the same time ultra festive. Martin fired up an inspirational ice-stal-chopping session as we were stopped but an almost complete blockage of ice in the entrace tunnel. Reaching a depth of approximately 100 meters we eventually decided that this was a black helmet danger zone. Huge television sized blocks of broken off ice was scattered around the shaft, and after a quick statistic calculation on when the next bit of ice could be coming down, we decided to blow retreat horn and hurried out after exhaustive cold caving session.

     Excellent job to the bottom. The route finding to the last pitch is a bit tricky until you realize you have to gnarl your way through a hole in the roof (upwards) with the festive aid of a spit/stal sling. The squeeze to the beginning of the last pitch is not as bad as it looks - go in feet first  and you can stand up half way (not imidiately obvious). Yoor!

     Really easy when you've already done it once (but not all the way to the deck). The approach was definitely the crux walking in thigh/waist deep snow to the cave. A festive day. Good effort from Andrew who hadn't caved for 10 years and was srt'ing on a rather made up and minimal rack.

     Long trip with an overnight camp in the Hard Rock Cafe. The further speed trip to The Microns was a seriously burly piece of work. Good effort from Martin doing the car shuttle on foot both ways and for the amble lager refreshments in the Hard Rock Cafe and Royston for the very inspirering bit of cave leading in the Rock Steady Cruise.

     Went up to have a look. Couldn't resist. Went in. Normal way too wet  so I opted for the highlevel dry fossil way which was much longer than I expected and with some pretty nasty (but polished and obvious) squezes. Good training  but cave soloing doesn't feel very clever.

     Main Shaft. Wild decent. Although the water level was low we ended up right in the end waterfall which is serious stuff and very scary but excellent adrenalin fun at the same time. The tick is home!

     A job needed to be finished. We wanted to finish yesterdays objective of getting to Smiths Armery but the area was in flood now and we made it past the traverses into OFD3 and reached the roaring streamway which was fantastic to watch but a certain deathtrap to enter. Great trip

     We did an unplanned round trip due to some tricky navigation in the Shambles. On one of the many tricky climbs Tom lobbed of and fell around three meters  but luckily landed on his feet and not on one of the sharp boulders. He sprained his angle badly and we abandoned the trip and got out safely.

     Jesper's first caving experience. Another team was already in there  which unfortunately took the edge of the scaryness factor and it was  really plain sailing. Still enjoyable.

     As festive as caving gets. This huge and relatively easy cave is  guarded by a big lake  which we crossed in my new rubber dinghy. Seriously  festive approach. Followed by a 6 meter steep climb directly from the  mooring spot and then a 30 meter high leve traverse with some fairly serious exposure. Great cave.

     Good SRT initiation trip for David. We went down the 40 meter pitch and then up again. Got through most of the SRT curriculum including a helping hand from above once or twice. It was raining heavily the whole day  but the cave stayed dry.
10-06-2001; CR; Trou de Glaz; ; 1h; DS; <3><C1>
     Went back for a further exploration. Annabel announced her disgust of the un-rock but David is keen on more. This cave is massive. Over 50  kilometers of known passageway with numerous through trips under Dent de  Crolles. The mountain is basically completely hollow and will be the focus  of activity in the near future. As with all Grenoblois speleoaction it  requires a fully equipped SRT team to explore.
24-05-2001; CR; Trou de Glaz; ; 20m; MB CW; <3><C1>
     Walked up the Dent de Crolles. Nipped in to a huge cavity with our c-rack.  Massive draft coming out of the cave. Will be back for further  exploration.

     Absolutely superb SRT trip. Beautiful lines and an amazing 40m drop from an overhanging speleothem. Easy and highly recommendable. Approach - 8 seconds from the car.

     Desperate trip. Got back up to the surface at 12'o'clock at night after a long day in the darkness. Our friends in Grenoble was getting well worried  and had started phoning the local police etc. Luckily they sensibly held  back any rescue attempts as we were perfectly fine. Glaciere de Scary!

     Excellent cave  ends in a big lake which goes of in the distance. Next  time we'll bring a boat and explore further. This time we both put the  double amount of clothes on and was relatively warm.

     I decided to postpone the UK underground retirement for one more trip - I  couldn't say no to a trip down Manor Farm with DG and MB. I wasn't  disappointed. Dave now goes under the nickname 'Mr. President' (president  for the HPCC) and I had the great pleasure of pushing through some really  dodgy loose bouldery bits in the far end which was rewarded with a huge  chamber which almost certainly had some further continuation. Dave and  Martin unfortunately didn't reach this glorious chamber as they reckoned  the boulder bits were too unstable.
18-11-2000; LL; Ogof y Daren Cilau; ; 6h; FW; <3><C4><3S>
     Did it! RR went with us for 10 meters and then decided to back out after  a worm attacked her in the entrance. We'd seriously misproportioned the  whole cave - the entrance crawl and chambers beyond was much bigger than  expected. We forgot the map which ment we couldn't make it further than the Great Chamber
16-11-2000; MD; Thrupe Lane Swallet; ; 4h; FW DG TW; <3><C2>
     Did the full through trip. A great evening out with TW and DG -  possible the last for a long time now that Fred is going back to Denmark and Mathias is going bigger voids in Grenoble.

     Brilliant trip. Laerke's first ever caving trip and she was so on for it  that we decided to do the full Goaty - into the letterbox and back. It's  f*cking scary in there - sort of smells of evil and it was a stupendious effort from the girls.

     The Rhoades sisters had an unsettled bill in the sump of this fine system.  We went all the way  through Cambridge Grotto to the Red Room. Good to be  back.

     Oh baby! This hole had been on the ticklist for quite some time and still  is! We had to turn back approx 350 meters in through the 530m crawl that  guards the cave. RR had some bad equipment and was freezing and we decided to go back before it would be too late. I have the feeling we will be back - soon.
25-09-2000; MD; GB Cavern; ; 3h; FW RR DG TR; <3><C2>
     Fine trip. Dave pointed out a number of challenges which we should attempt  soon.

     We got as far as the 'very narrow tube' and despite Mathias' attempt of  squeezing through in underpants only  there was no way it would go. Good  trip.

     Our sister Henriette went to Bristol to figure out why her brothers like  caving. She didn't find the answer  but found out she is definitely not  desperate to get underground again. Instead we went on an <a href="http://willerup.com/boat/bath.html">epic trip on the narrowboat</a>

     A job needed to be done and TW and I went in to finish the Fairy Cave  business. We reached the 'Red Room' which is in the connected Hilliers  Cave and is the furtherst reach of the system. Quite an amazing system and  very well worth it. Recommendable 
21-11-1999; MD; Fairy Quarry Cave; ; 1h; MI; <3><C2>; <I http://willerup.com/caving/fairy/fairy-mik.jpg>
     Not an ideal trip. I forgot to stock up on carbide  and didn't have a lot of juice in the batteries. So we went in as far as the duck  and probably partly because I was nervous about the lights  Mikkel didn't fancy the duck  and we blew retreat and went out. Shame  because I would have liked to show Mikkel the Red Room.

     We were back to complete the round trip that we had attempted with Peter  three entries down. This time the mud sump that we had rushed through was  filled to the roof with water and after an hour or more of pumping water  with no noticeable effect we went to explore the Black Hole Series  instead. This ended when we arrived at a 40 foot pitch. Good day out. We  were both exhausted

     An excellent trip! We went into the St. Poul Grotto Series which included  some very low crawls and passing a mud sump. Peter did well in this -not-  a beginners section of the cave. We didn't manage the through trip though  since Peter started having more than enough. We didn't realize that this actually was our probably one and only chance of ticking this sought after Swildons collectors piece. Bummer!
31-05-1999; MD; Swildons Hole; ; 4h; FW TW RR; <3>
     Good Trip. Theresa and Rene both did Sump 1 in freezing cold water and in  a very uninviting condition. Rene even managed to become a 'Son of The Mendips' as she fell into one of the pools twice.

     After the failed attempt in Swildons we went for the Goatchurch instead -  objective: to go through the drainpipe. We got to it after some persuasion  but that was as far as the party wanted to go. Drainpipe 2 - Lars Klammer  0

     The entrance of Otter Hole has an exiting feature. The river Wye is tidal so the entrance is only open an hour or two during low tide. When the  water comes in the entrance (and exit!) closes for about 10 hours which  means that once we enter we are comitted for the whole day.

    Just as I thought I was getting comfortable with it all Allan phone me up with a last chance before going back to CPH to try towing. I said yes and got towed up to 300 meters height and then released my thingy and had a mad mad flight down to earth. It was absolutely mental and I was just screaming and giggling the whole way down. Awesome kick!
29-06-2010; JL; Toftum; ; 4h; PP; <7><3S>; <I https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/4741298211_1fd61e9fee_b.jpg>
    Brilliant session with lots of top landing and take offs. Managed to stay from the beach the whole time and was generally pretty much comfortable with everything. Great fun.
23-06-2010; JL; Bovbjerg Fyr; ; 4h; PP; <7>
    Another great session at Bovbjerg. This time top starting and just enough wind to keep on hanging. It required care with the flying and I ended up on the beach a few times. Biggest tick was a couple of 100% self supported take-offs from a remoter spot and flying back to the others gaining height. Super satisfying.
17-06-2010; JL; Bovbjerg; ; 4h; PP; <7><3S>
    Awesome session learning to beach start. Quite tricky and also a notch up on the danger scale. Really good fun though flying low over the sand dunes and taking off and landing constantly. Also went with PP; <7> flying all over to the lighthouse which was a great trip.

    The tick is in the bag! Ever since the first session in Toftum this place remained number one on the ticklist. Great session feeling really in control all the time. The new school wing is really comfortable and launches and handles really smooth. Did 3 succesfull top landings and 2 beach landings. The wind picked up in the end making the last run a bit epic.
05-05-2010; JL; Hamborg; ; 1h; PP; <7><3S>
    Fully self supported with Poul on the ground obviously. Had some crash landings which I learned a lot from. Landed with my bum on the top  on the slope (controlled)  and in a fence (not controled).

    Glass flat water but with a light breeze. Moored up at Brincks boye and swam in to shore for a beer. Daren drum useful for keeping the towel and clothes dry on the swim. Brilliant.

    In the search for pancake flat water I went out in pure off shore wind at a place where the water gets deep quickly and in really cold water (only just finished April). Eventually I fell over and could get the kite back up in time before the water was getting me really cold. I decided to quickly emergency release the kite (which wasn't trivial) and swim to shore. The kite took off on its own on the water. I drove to the nearest harbour and chartered a boat to go out and rescue the kite. Quite an epic afternoon.

##### Snowboarding #####
14-05-2001; CH; Chamonix; ; ; solo; <9><S>
    Got the randonee skis out and revisited the Grande Jorasse basin where Fred and I had been 7 years ago. Went up to Refuge Lascaux (2450m) and headed back. Brilliant trip. 6 hours
29-04-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; solo; <9><S>
    Definitely the last run of the season. Lovely day, lots of sunshine but quite desperate snow conditions. I was almost caught in the biggest avalanche I have ever seen - I was completely alone on the whole Vallon side just catching my breath right under La Meije. I hear a crraaaackk, look up and boy oh boy oh boy, the whole serac fall is coming down. Absolutely mind-blowing to watch. It was just getting bigger and bigger in classic avalanche style - you know, developing this huge cloud of snow thundering down toward the valley floor right where I was standing. I waited a few second admiring the spectacle and then I was okay, that actually looks like a bad job and I started the engines and got further away while I could. I stopped some 500 meters further down and looked up again. Like some big disgusting animal the avalanche ate its way down the face and 30 seconds or so later engulfed the place where I had been in cloud and debris. Eventually it reached where I now was but was now a mere wind of snow. Absolutely fantastic to see. All other stuff was very avalanchy as well, but nothing as major as that baby. If only I'd brought my camera. I switched to my skiis midday but changed back to the gun after one desperate run.
22-04-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; solo; <9>
    Brilliant day. Worked on trying to jump the big serac thing on the left of the drag lift in the top. It's a massive drop and the landing is not very steep so you really gotta go for it all the way. I was there a couple of times but didn't do it. Even Tigers has limits. :-) - I successfully did my usual cliff jump on the left of the telepherique which is always amazingly adreanline pumpy.
21-04-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; solo; <9>
    Woke up. Looked at the webcam. Looked good. Headed off. Scrounged my way to a free lift ride. Conditions was pretty desperate actually. Fresh snow but very cold and the base was rock solid (not good for the big air landings). Also the avalance risk was quite obvious very high and I was glad to reach the bottom in one piece
13-04-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; MB; <9><3S>
    Superb day. Excellent big air jumps and some really pumping carving. Absolutely shagged afterwards also partly because of heavy drinking at the previous night with Martin, Christian Holst and forty bottles of bottles of Christians vodka
12-04-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; MB; <9>
    Gnarled around a bit to figure out what the best descend would be with the access to P2 being unskiable. Perfect weather and only few people
08-04-2001; LG; Sherre Chevalier; ; ; SN; <9>
    Plenty of untouched snow, but weather a bit unstable. Good fun

    Steep aaaaand deep. Did my favourite left side (facing the mountain) exclusively. Lot of queing in the lift unfortunately
17-03-2001; LG; Alpe Duez; ; ; DS; <9>
    Did some excellent cliff jumps. Visibility was poor but due to heavy snowfall
10-03-2001; LG; Courchevel; ; PD; DS; <9>
    Despite quite crazy conditions (fluffy snow, sun, fog, snowstorm, rain, slush - all in a day) we managed to get some good stuff done. Good jumps.

    David and Annabel joined me for the evening and we had a good day skiing/boarding. Still plenty of deep snow
10-02-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; RG; <9>
    It had snowed a lot the previous day and we arrived to a perfect morning. Perfect snow, lots of it, no people
04-02-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; solo; <9>
    Ice climbed Saturday and it then snowed 30cm during the night and Sunday was a real treat on the gun. Excellent cornice surfing on the Vallons side. I think I've found my favourite line in La Grave. If only the lift didn't close so early (4pm). I was the third one down the slope in the morning though!
28-01-2001; CH; Chamonix; ; ; ; <9>
    Still powder left from the day before and an excellent snowdepth, soft and perfect for trying some festive jumps. 
27-01-2001; GR; Sept Laux; ; ; PD; <9>
    It had snowed in the morning, and the bastards closed the top bit (avalance danger) so I was confined to the piste. :-(

    First time in the local ski resort. Good potential
21-01-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; ; <9>
    Only fresh powder on the very top section - really good stuff. The lower parts was icy and tricky on the Powder Gun
14-01-2001; LG; La Grave; ; ; solo; <9>
    Bought a Swell Panik Magistral board and had the most amazing day in La Grave. 10-20cm of fresh powder under clear blue sky. 
02-01-2001; LG; Alpe Duez; ; ; RG; <9><R>
    It changed from rain to snow mid day. We should have stayed one more day

    Spend the New Year break in Alpe D'huez the closest big resort to my new home in Grenoble
01-01-2000; LG; La Grave; ; ; JR LK; <9><3S>
    A week to check out the powder in Chamonix and La Grave. Great trip together with the skiers Jesper Ritzau and Lars Klammer. No trip report. No photos. But we have a fully edited movie (9 MB!)

    Did the Col de Palet to Champagny run (alone!). A bit irresponsible in retrospect. Desperate on a snowboard
01-01-1996; CH; Chamonix; ; ; FW; <9>
    We only had three days as the following days was ear marked for Christmas purposes. There where a lot of nice offpiste riding
01-01-1995; CH; Chamonix; ; ; solo; <9>
    Spent two months in Chamonix, one week in Serre Chevalier (and La Grave) and one week in Val d'Isere. The off piste conditions in Val d'Isere was unbelievably good.

 Tim did a "Double Wye Valley run" today - I was climbing, but I thought this should be noted. Double! If the normal round wasn't hard enough, but doing it it twice - pfeww. Well done Tim.

 Agony. I thought it would never go. If I want to get the sub2 again I need to rethink be current diet of beer and crisps. Still - I was going allright from the field to Tutshill, so I was quite pleased with the time.
01-11-1999; LD; KIMM 37K; ; 11h45m; FW; <9> 
 We came in 68 of 197 teams in the C class. 69 of these retired after the first day - 128 completed. (2.200m of ascent)
10-10-1999; WV; Wye Valley 19K; ; 2h25m; solo; <9> 
 Tried to use ski poles. Disaster. It screwed up my rythm and I struggled all the way through! Ok, I hadn't really had any thing to eat, so I was quite low on energy, but - my ski pole theory has proven wrong.

 Complete torture. No problems in legs but the lungs and overall stamina was suffering seriously from the extreme heat. I came in 15th. It was not pleasant. Ridiculously hot (25+ degrees). Worst conditions I have ever run in.
16-6-1999; CW; Cotswold Leg 5 (recce) 18K; ; 1h52m; TW; <9> 
 Calves killing me, otherwise the run was great. We were chased by a flock of cows at some stage.

 Up until the top of Wyndcliffe my left calf was in absolute agony, but then it started loosening up after that. Boy was I glad when I ran across the bridge in Chepstow. New record for The Run which I am sure will not stand long
06-06-1999; WV; Wye Valley 19K; ; 2h59m; LS; <9>
 We were supposed to have been 6 people going but the other potential participants seemed to have lost their attitude. Still, Linsey and I went and it was as always a fine Valley experience.
03-6-1999; WV; Wye Valley 19K; ; 2h05m; TW; <9>
 Perfect! The seasons first after work run. It looked like it was going to be a mean run, but after reaching the otter hole car park things seemed to just go really smoothly and no pain in the knees which is great.
28-4-1999; WV; HP Extended Valley 12K; ; 0h54m; TW; <9> 
 Beautiful. I have started running more frequently and on less savage terrain. All systems are working fine. No problems with knees or anything. So I guess I just need to go easy on the actual fell runs.
21-2-1999; SJ; Furesøen Rundt 18K; ; 1h45m; LK; <9> 
 Changed to my old more bouncy shoes. I think it helped a bit on my knee, though it still hurt quite a lot. Specially afterwards. Good trip though - but less hilly than I had hoped. Denmark just is flat as a pancake.
14-2-1999; WV; Wye Valley 19K; ;  2h43m; ; <9>
 Right knee really painful. Maybe it is my beloved Walsh shoes which are a bit too hardcore after all.

 Great conditions. Misty, wet and not too windy. Right knee hurting. After five hours I twist my ankle badly and we decide to retire and manage to arrive at the midway campsite after an additional 3 hours struggle. Read the full story.
27-06-1998; CW; Cotswold Relay 16K; ; 1h18m; TW; <9> 
 Team 62 Ideal conditions. Muddy as hell and sun and showers during the run. Despite the fact that my shoes are crap it went okay. I came in 19th of 45 participants. Tim, who ran the leg as well came in 10th, three minuttes before me. Excellent fun. Right knee hurting quite a bit otherwise okay.
23-06-1998; CW; Cotswold Recce 16K; ; ; TW; <9> 
 Practice Run for the race on Saturday
20-06-1998; WV; Wye Valley 19K; ; 2h18m; TW CL; <9> 
 Worst ever: Hot. Humid. Muddy and slippery. I lead. Tim runs with Claire. Totally exhausted hardest run yet. No blisters. Picked up Claire in Tintern.
01-01-1998; WV; Wye Valley 19K; ; 2h05m; TW; <9>
 After work run. I left the field after Devils Pulpit and was alone until the last road section near Chepstow. Fine conditions. Big bloody blister on left toe.
01-01-1998; WV; Wye Valley 19K; ; 2h18m; TW; <9>
 Muddy. Wet ground. Snow. Good. Good Run - very wet, otherwise good conditions. Snowed on the higher grounds. Blister
